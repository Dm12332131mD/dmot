## About

### Introduction

Dmot is an open-source, multi-purpose, fully-customizable, utility Discord bot written in JavaScript using [Node.js (v16.13.2)](https://nodejs.org) and [Discord.js v13.6.0](https://discord.js.org/#/). It was created on December 22, 2018 as a side-project to learn and practice JavaScript by Dm123321_31mD Gaming. It quickly turned into a public utility Discord Bot as more people begin to notice Dmot. On March 13, 2022, Dmot officially became open-source.

### Forking

You can create your own spin-off of Dmot by forking this repository. See how to do that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

After you have done so, create a `.env` file with the following content inside:

```env
TOKEN="INSERT-YOUR-TOKEN"
```

> **WARNING**: DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN WITH ANYONE WHO YOU DO NOT TRUST.

Within the `config.json`, you can configure the client by editing the values. Below is the default configuration in case the original is tampered or lost:

```json
{
    "commandsPath": "commands/",
    "maintenance": false,
    "sessionPath": "./logs/latest.log"
}
```

To launch the client, open a terminal within the root directory and enter the following:

```bash
node .
```

Or if you have [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) installed globally:

```bash
nodemon .
```

Feel free to edit the source code using the API documented below. Good luck!
