## About
Dmot is an open-source, user-friendly [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot created by Dm123321_31mD Gaming. It uses the [Node.js v16.13.2](https://nodejs.org/en/) framework and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library to interact with the Discord API. It was first developed in 2018 as a personal project used to experiment with the Node.js engine. It was later expanded as a free-for-all, public utility client.
